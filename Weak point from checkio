The durability map is represented as a matrix with digits. Each number is the durability measurement for the cell. To find the weakest point we should find the weakest row and column. The weakest point is placed in the intersection of these rows and columns. Row (column) durability is a sum of cell durability in that row (column). You should find coordinates of the weakest point (row and column). The first row (column) is 0th row (column). If a section has several equal weak points, then choose the closest point to the top edge and if there are multiple points closest to the top edge, then choose from those points the point that is closest to the left edge.
Input: A durability map as a list of lists with integers.
Output: The coordinates of the weak point as a list (tuple) of integers.
Example:
weak_point([[7, 2, 7, 2, 8],
            [2, 9, 4, 1, 7],
            [3, 8, 6, 2, 4],
            [2, 5, 2, 9, 1],
            [6, 6, 5, 4, 5]]) == [3, 3]
weak_point([[7, 2, 4, 2, 8],
            [2, 8, 1, 1, 7],
            [3, 8, 6, 2, 4],
            [2, 5, 2, 9, 1],
            [6, 6, 5, 4, 5]]) == [1, 2]
Precondition:
0 < len( matrix ) â‰¤ 10
all(len(row) == len( matrix ) for row in matrix )
all(all(0 < x < 10 for x in row) for row in matrix )

def weak_point(matrix):
    a = [sum(x) for x in matrix]
    b = []
    d = 0    
    for j in range(len(matrix)):
        for i in matrix:
            d += i[j]
        b.append(d)
        d = 0
    return [a.index(min(a)), b.index(min(b))]
