I start to feed one of the pigeons. A minute later two more fly by and a minute after that another 3. Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute, but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons who arrived first ate first. Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop. If I have N portions of bird feed, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?
Input: A quantity of portions wheat as a positive integer. Output: The number of fed pigeons as an integer.
Precondition: 0 < N < 105.

def checkio(food: int) -> int:
    a, b, c = [0], [0], [0]
    for x in range(0, 84):
        a.append(x+1)
        b.append(b[-1] + a[-1])
        c.append(c[-1] + b[-1])
        if c[-1] == food:
            return b[-1]
        elif c[-1] > food:
            return food - c[-2] if (food - c[-2]) > b[-2] else b[-2]
