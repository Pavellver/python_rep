This module is responsible for his number pronunciation. He has to click to input all of the numerical digits in a figure, so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time. Help the robot to speak properly and increase his number processing speed by writing a new speech module for him. All the words in the string must be separated by exactly one space character. Be careful with spaces - it's hard to see if you place two spaces instead one.
Input: An integer. Output: String.
Precondition: 0 < number < 1000
